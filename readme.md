# About ðŸ‘€

The Cliger is a management application for micro, small and medium companies, the idea behind the Cliger would be to help these entrepreneurs to plan better, since in Brazil most companies close in less than a year because of stupid decisions and a really bad administration.<br>
but how will the cliger help me, you ask me, well we will expose numbers, data, graphs, predictions among other things that most of these small entrepreneurs  don't even know about the existence<br>
Also, it is necessary to say that this is the Second part of the project, the first part, the server (Which By the Way is necessary for the app Run) is here https://github.com/GuztaJF-DS/Cliger-Server i recomend you take a look, if you haven't yet.<br>
i need to say that i Decided to have the Sign In and Sign Up parts Finished Before Create the Repo, don't Ask me Why i decided to make that way, but i did
Finally i didn't port the app for the IOS Because i don't have a Mac OS or even a IPhone, and sincerely i don't plan to buy any of these, so fell free to port the app, if you want of course
